### Storyboard
-----
The game begins with a soft fade into the sound of wind blowing through a forest, as the screen slowly reveals a figure lying still beneath a tree canopy—our Main Character, cloaked in a red robe and blue garments, their sword Aelvantar half-buried in moss. The forest around them is unnaturally quiet, save for the rustling of leaves that seem to whisper. They awaken with no memory, only the lingering impression of sorrow—and a stone arch glowing faintly nearby. Upon activating it, the forest shifts, a path opens, and the journey through Eidwynd Hollow begins.



### Thornswept Vale (Stages 1–3)
-----
The player is introduced to the core mechanics: fluid run-and-jump platforming, combat using Aelvantar, and the collection of Forest Coins to upgrade physical stats. Strange brambles block progress, glowing insects guide the player, and eerie statues watch from the shadows. Here, the player meets Ira the Lanternkeeper, a wistful NPC with fading memories. Through her, the player begins to piece together the forest’s temporal instability and the value of lost memories. The final boss of this biome guards the first Memory Orb, offering a cryptic, fragmented vision of the main character’s past, someone dressed not in robes, but in battle armor.



### Glassgrove (Stages 4–6)
-----
The environment becomes crystalline and reflective both visually and narratively. Enemies appear as corrupted reflections of the main character, hinting at emotional duality. The forest feels alive with secrets. The player meets Sova, the herbalist whose potions unlock deeper layers of memory. Through him, players learn about the forest’s pull on those carrying emotional burdens. Thorne, a rogue monster hunter with a mysterious past, also appears, offering both aid and challenge. Her storyline adds tension, revealing the forest's role as both sanctuary and prison. The second Memory Orb reveals scenes of the main character failing to protect others, a guilt that still haunts them.
The Hollowheart (Stages 7–9): 
Time collapses entirely. The same area may look and behave differently on repeat visits. Music warps, colors shift, and previous decisions subtly change the forest’s tone. The Choir, ghostly children speaking in unison appear more frequently, reflecting the emotional echo of Eidwynd itself. Here, the gameplay introduces environmental storytelling more heavily, with puzzles that bend physics and challenge perception. The final boss here is a fractured memory made by the lost souls that the main character couldn’t save. Upon its defeat, the third Memory Orb reveals the truth: the player character died long ago during a forest battle. Their form now is a vessel born from collective regret, stitched together by the will of the fallen.



### Finale (The True Ending)
-----
Unlocks when the player has collected all Memory Orbs. The Choir summons the player to the heart of Eidwynd. Through a dreamlike sequence, truths unravel: the forest is not a place, but a sentient memory-space that remembers every soul who passed through it in anguish. The final level is more symbolic than combative. Instead of a boss fight, the player must navigate emotional trials—flashbacks, moral dilemmas, and echoes of those they've helped along the way. The final scene has the Choir reciting:
“You were a soldier once, one death among thousands. But grief remembered you. Regret shaped you. And from the silence between final breaths, something greater was born. You are not just one soul. You are the echo of all who never made it home.”

The screen fades as the player’s form dissolves into light, scattering across the forest. The Stone Arches, now all activated, glow in unison, offering a path for others to remember and be remembered.
